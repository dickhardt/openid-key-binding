# OpenID Key Binding 1.0

This repository contains the proposed OpenID Key Binding specification.


## Overview

Some applications use proof of possession of a private key for authentication. OpenID Connect provides a protocol to delegate authentication and obtain identity claims to another service. This document specifies an extension to the OpenID Connect flow to bind a public key to an OpenID Connect ID Token.

## Status

This document is draft that the authors are expecting to propose for adoption by the OpenID Foundation AB/Connect Working Group.
